You are Replit AI. Access the repo (frontend/, backend/). Perform a **frontend-only redesign & validation overhaul**. DO NOT touch backend.

🎯 GOALS
1. Fully redesign the UI (modern, responsive, RTL/LTR, Arabic + English).
2. Fix all client-side validation in Setup, Login, Signup.
3. Make Setup create admin on first run via existing backend endpoint (no backend edits). Block re-setup after success.
4. Improve Login/Signup flows: password strength meter, proper inline errors, retry cooldown.
5. Use centralized validation utils, consistent error mapping, and friendly bilingual messages.
6. Keep backend contracts (URLs, methods, status codes) untouched.
7. Add light theme with green accent. Responsive + accessible UI.
8. Add smoke test (`frontend/tests/smoke.test.js`) to verify setup, login, render (no JS errors).
9. Create feature branch: `feat/frontend-redesign-setup-fixes` → single PR with changelog, screenshots, QA checklist.

🧠 STEPS
- Identify entry points (index, App, router) & forms (Setup, Login, Signup).
- Add `frontend/src/utils/validation.js` and reusable `FormWrapper`.
- Replace old CSS with clean design tokens (fonts: Inter + Noto Naskh Arabic).
- Add `frontend/src/i18n/en.json`, `ar.json` for UI strings.
- Implement Setup flow: POST to backend, on success set localStorage flag, redirect to login, show messages.
- Handle backend errors safely; log unknown fields; never modify backend.
- Add `FRONTEND_CHANGELOG.md` with what changed + rollback steps.
- PR must include QA checklist, smoke test results, before/after screenshots.

⚙️ QA CHECKLIST
- [ ] Setup creates admin, cannot re-run.
- [ ] Validation works in all forms (Arabic + English).
- [ ] Login handles 401/422 properly.
- [ ] Password meter & inline errors show correctly.
- [ ] No backend changes.
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds.

If any backend issue appears, open an issue titled `Backend contract unclear for <endpoint>` instead of editing backend.

Focus: **Frontend-only radical redesign + validation & setup fixes**, clean, tested, modern, and bilingual.
