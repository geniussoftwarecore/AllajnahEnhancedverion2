üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Security & Reliability
1. Environment Variables for Production
Currently using default secrets. Before going live, you should:

Change the JWT secret key (currently using a default)
Set proper CORS origins (currently allows all origins)
Use strong, unique passwords for all demo accounts
2. Rate Limiting
Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse:

Limit login attempts (prevent brute force attacks)
Limit complaint submissions per user per day
Limit file uploads
3. File Upload Security
Your system accepts file uploads. Add:

File type validation (only images/PDFs)
File size limits (already configured, but enforce strictly)
Virus scanning for uploaded files
Store files in secure cloud storage (not local filesystem)
4. Password Policy
Current passwords like "admin123" are too weak. Implement:

Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
Password strength meter on registration
Force password change on first login for admin accounts
üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Performance & Scalability
5. Database Optimization
Add indexes for frequently queried fields:

-- Add these indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_complaints_status ON complaints(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_complaints_category ON complaints(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_complaints_assigned ON complaints(assigned_to_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_complaints_trader ON complaints(trader_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user ON audit_logs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_created ON audit_logs(created_at);

6. API Response Caching
Cache frequently accessed data:

Categories list (rarely changes)
System settings (rarely changes)
Dashboard statistics (cache for 5 minutes)
7. Pagination Improvements
Some endpoints return all results. Add pagination to:

Comments list
Attachments list
Larger complaint lists
üü¢ RECOMMENDED - User Experience
8. Email/SMS Notifications
You have notification hooks ready. Integrate with:

SendGrid or Mailgun for emails
Twilio for SMS alerts
Notify traders when complaint status changes
Notify committees when new complaints assigned
Send subscription expiry reminders
9. Real-time Updates
Consider adding WebSocket support for:

Live notification badges
Real-time complaint status updates
Committee chat/collaboration
10. Export Functionality
Add data export features:

Export analytics to CSV/Excel
Export audit logs for compliance
Generate PDF reports for complaints
Print-friendly complaint summaries
11. Advanced Search
Enhance search capabilities:

Full-text search across complaints
Multi-field filtering
Save search filters as presets
Advanced date range queries
12. Mobile App Considerations
Your API is ready for mobile. Consider:

React Native mobile app
Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration
Push notifications via Firebase
üîµ NICE TO HAVE - Advanced Features
13. Automated Workflow
Currently you have basic automation. Enhance with:

Scheduled background tasks (cron jobs for SLA checks)
Auto-reminder emails before SLA breach
Escalation rules based on complaint complexity
14. Analytics Enhancements
Add more insights:

Trend analysis (complaints over time charts)
Committee performance metrics
Response time by category
Trader satisfaction trends
15. Multi-language API Responses
Currently UI is bilingual, but API responses are in English. Consider:

Return Arabic error messages based on user preference
Bilingual email templates
16. Integration APIs
Expose APIs for third-party integration:

Government entity portals can check complaint status
Integration with national ID systems
Payment gateway integration (instead of proof upload)
‚öôÔ∏è Production Deployment Checklist
Before publishing, ensure:

‚úÖ Security

‚úÖ Performance

 Add database indexes
 Enable gzip compression
 Configure CDN for static assets
 Set up database backups
‚úÖ Monitoring

 Set up error logging (Sentry, LogRocket)
 Configure uptime monitoring
 Set up performance monitoring
 Create admin alerts for critical errors
‚úÖ Documentation

 Update API documentation with actual domain
 Create user training materials
 Prepare admin operation manual
 Document disaster recovery procedures
‚úÖ Legal & Compliance

 Add privacy policy
 Add terms of service
 GDPR compliance (if applicable)
 Data retention policies
üéØ My Top 3 Immediate Recommendations
If you want to improve the system right now, focus on these three:

Add Email Notifications - This will dramatically improve user experience. Traders want to know immediately when their complaint status changes.

Implement Database Indexes - Quick win for performance. Will make the system much faster as data grows.

Add Export to CSV - Admins and committees need to generate reports. This is highly valuable for management.
