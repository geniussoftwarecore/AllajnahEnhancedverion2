# Allajnah Enhanced - Complaint Management System

## Overview
Allajnah Enhanced is a comprehensive complaint management system designed for Yemeni traders and oversight committees. Its core purpose is to streamline the submission, tracking, and resolution of complaints against government entities through a multi-level committee review workflow. The system aims to enhance transparency and accountability in governmental operations.

## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with a focus on completing core functionalities first, then refining and adding advanced features. I value clear, concise explanations and prefer to be asked before major architectural or design changes are implemented. All user-facing text should support both Arabic and English, with Arabic being the primary language and using an RTL layout. Please follow existing code patterns for consistency.

## System Architecture
The system is built with a clear separation of concerns using a backend in Python with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, and a frontend in React with Vite and TailwindCSS.

### UI/UX Decisions
-   **Language Support**: Full Arabic language support with RTL layout is prioritized, with English translation in progress. i18next is used for internationalization.
-   **Design System**: TailwindCSS is used for a utility-first CSS approach, ensuring a consistent and responsive design.

### Technical Implementations
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with robust role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL is used as the relational database, managed with SQLAlchemy ORM.
-   **Workflow Automation**: Includes auto-assignment of complaints, SLA monitoring with auto-escalation, and auto-closing of resolved complaints after inactivity.
-   **Duplicate Detection**: Utilizes text similarity (SequenceMatcher) to warn users about potential duplicate complaints before submission, with a configurable threshold.
-   **Notification Hooks**: A module is in place with stub functions for key events, ready for integration with external notification services (e.g., email, SMS).
-   **Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard statistics and administrative analytics are available, including time-range filters, SLA breaches, subscription statuses, and resolution rates.
-   **Audit Trail**: A system-wide audit log tracks key actions, users, and timestamps.

### Feature Specifications
-   **User Roles**:
    -   **Trader**: Submits complaints, tracks status, manages subscriptions.
    -   **Technical Committee**: Reviews, assigns, updates complaints, and escalates them.
    -   **Higher Committee**: Full administrative access, user management, system settings, and final decision-making.
-   **Complaint Workflow**: Complaints progress through "Submitted," "Under Review," "Escalated," and "Resolved" or "Rejected" statuses, with options for re-opening and feedback collection.
-   **Subscription & Payment Management**: Traders manage annual subscriptions, upload payment proofs, which are then approved/rejected by committees, activating subscriptions.
-   **Admin Management**: CRUD operations for users, categories, payment methods, SLA configurations, and system settings.

### System Design Choices
-   **Modularity**: The project is structured into `backend/` and `frontend/` directories, promoting clear separation and maintainability.
-   **API-First Approach**: The backend exposes a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs to serve the frontend and potential future integrations.
-   **Scalability**: Chosen technologies (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL) are suitable for scaling.
